# SudokuSolver
A Java API that solves Sudoku grids

## About

The year was 2005, there were no iPhones or Androids and Sudoku puzzles exploded in popularity;

This project started out as a simple little Java J2ME program to store a few games, allow the user to enter custom games and solve the grids. 
The world of J2ME is practically obsolete (although still exists) now with the advent of smart phones that can run full Java. 

I've taken the solver related classes from that project and put it in to an API here to solve grids. 

As the original was written to run in J2ME (CLDC 1.1) there were several restrictions in the API's available, so a lot of manual array manipulation has been, and will continue to be, modified here.
